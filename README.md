# Sentiment-Analysis-From-Web-Scraped-Text-
Welcome to Sentiment Analysis of Web Scraped Text! This project utilizes the powerful combination of web scraping with Beautiful Soup and sentiment analysis with NLTK to gain insights into the emotional tone of text sourced from various web pages.

Project Overview
In this project, I employ web scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup to extract text data from a diverse array of web pages. Once I have collected the textual content, I leverage NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for sentiment analysis. NLTK provides a robust set of tools and algorithms for processing and understanding natural language, making it an ideal choice for sentiment analysis tasks.

Analyzing Sentiment
By applying sentiment analysis to the scraped text, we can categorize the emotional tone of the content into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This enables us to gain valuable insights into the prevailing attitudes and opinions expressed within the text.
